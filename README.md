A simple 2d game.

I tried to make a 3d Unituy game but because of the bugs I can't deal with so I tried to make a 2d game. Also I forgot the information of my first submit form so I submit a new one and create a new repo to update my work.

2d is easier than 3d but it still cost a lot of time to work on it. So I decided to finish it and update this project.

I used Unity as the game engine and learned C# by myself. And after so many days work  finally I have made a demo version of this game.

This 2d game is very simple but hard to play. Only thing need to do is press Space on keyboard to throw needles to the spin circle.

I have set 4 levels and I think this game is pretty hard.

Thanks for watching and playing my game.
